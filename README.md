**Trustor** - The trustor assumes the role of an evaluator within an IoV network to assess and ascertain the trustworthiness of a trustee. In our proposed dataset, there are 80 trustors listed in column 1 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**Trustee** - The trustee, also referred to as a target node or a host node, is an entity that is evaluated by a trustor as either trustworthy or untrustworthy. In our proposed dataset, there are 79 trustees (listed in column 2 of the dataset) that have encountered 96,707 interactions with trustors. <br/><br/>
**Packet Delivery Rate (PDR)** - The Packet Delivery Rate (0=< PDR <=1) measures the degree of interaction between a trustor and a trustee at a time instance t within an IoV network, thereby providing a key understanding of their relationship ((listed in column 3 of the dataset). <br/><br/>
**Similarity (Sim)** - The similarity (0=< Sim <=1) between a trustor and a trustee at a time instance t encompasses both external similarity (ES) and internal similarity (IS), and is a weighted amalgamation of the two. The same is listed in column 4 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**External Similarity (ES)** - The external similarity (0=< ES <=1) suggests the extent to which a trustor and a trustee access similar content at a time instance t, and is listed in column 5 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**Internal Similarity (IS)** - The internal similarity (0=< IS <=1) manifests the degree of similarity in the positions (geographical locations), directions (travelling trajectories), velocities and accelerations of a trustor and trustee. The same is depicted in column 6 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**Familiarity (Fam)** - The familiarity (0=< Fam <=1) between a trustor and a trustee at a time instance t is also segregated into external familiarity (EF) and internal familiarity (IF). The same is delineated in column 7 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**External Familiarity (EF)** - The external familiarity (0=< EF <=1) quantifies the level of familiarity a trustor possesses towards a trustee, and is listed in column 8 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
**Internal Familiarity (IF)** - The internal familiarity (0=< IF <=1) denotes the extent of interaction frequency between trustor and trustee over timestamp t, and is recorded in column 9 of the dataset. <br/><br/>
**Reward/Punishment (RP)** - The reward and punishment (0=< RP <=1) is utilized to assess the rewards and penalties allocated to a trustee by a trustor based on its conduct, specifically, a trustee is rewarded by a trustor for exhibiting cooperation, honesty, and reporting critical events while being penalized for any misconduct, and is represented in column 10 of the dataset. <br/><br/>
**Context** - The context (0=< context <=1) means the vehicle network communication quality, and is listed in column 11 of the dataset.<br/><br/>
